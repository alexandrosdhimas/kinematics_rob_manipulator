# Introduction

This is a term project for an undergraduate Robotics course in the University of Patras. The objectives are:

- Solve the forward kinematics problem
- Give an analytical solution for the Inverse kinematics problem
- Incoporate the RMRC Path Planning Algorithm for a straight line in a welding process

The chosen robot is a KUKA KR 16 R1610-2 with 6 degrees of freedom.
