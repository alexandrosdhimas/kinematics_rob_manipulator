## Introduction
This is a term project for an undergraduate Robotics course in the University of Patras. The objectives are to:

- Solve the forward kinematics problem.

- Give an analytic solution for the inverse kinematics problem.

- Incorporate the Resolved Motion Rate Control (RMRC) algorithm in order to create a straight line path witch simulates a welding process

We assume that a [KUKA KR 16 R1610-2](https://www.kuka.com/-/media/kuka-downloads/imported/6b77eecacfe542d3b736af377562ecaa/0000321015_en.pdf?rev=20f511ef7e0c47fe987dfa0f848ff85b&hash=AC1B029A917A8FEB6D95DEBFBC2E2873) is used to complete the task.

## Inverse kinematics
In the inverse kinematics problem we are concerned with finding the joint angles for a specific pose of the end effector. A modified version of the solution incorporated by [1] for the Puma 560 robot is used. We evaluate every solution of the set of eight possible solutions and the last one is accepted.

## RMRC Algorithm
Velocities in Joint Space are transformed to Cartesian space by:
$$\bar V = J_v(\bar q) \dot {\bar q}$$
Where $\bar V$ the velocity vector of the end effector, $\dot {\bar q}$ the joint space velocity vector and $J_v(\bar q)$ the Geometric Jacobian matrix. Given a nonsingular $J_v(\bar q)$ we obtain:

$$\dot {\bar q}= {J_v}^{-1}(\bar q)\bar V$$
The joint position vector is given by:

$$\bar q = \bar q_0 + \int _0^t {\dot{\bar q}} dt$$

where subscript "i" coresponds to initial position and "f" to final. dt Is the selected time step.
